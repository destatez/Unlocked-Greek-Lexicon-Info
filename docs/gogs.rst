Working with Door43 Git Service
==========

Forking the repository
----------------------

Before you begin working on creating or modifying files in one of the the Unlocked Lexicon repositories, you will need to fork the project's repository.

1. Sign in to your Door43 account at https://git.door43.org/.
2. Click **Fork** near the upper right-hand corner of the site.
3. In the *New Fork Repository* window, keep the default Repository Name and Description and click on the **Fork Repository** button. 

.. note:: Once you have forked the repository, you will need to work from the files on your fork only. Once you have committed changes to a file on your fork and it is free of syntax erros, you are ready to merge those changes to the Master repo. To do this you will need to create a Pull Request.

.. _pullrequest:

Creating a Pull Request
-----------------------

When you have completed work on a file and are ready for it to be reviewed and merged to the master repository, you will need to create a Pull Request that will be reviewed by another team member before being merged to the master repo.
 
1. On the master repository site, click on **Pull Requests** near the top of the page, then click on the **New Pull Request** button. The site will compare your fork with the master repository and show differences at the bottom of the page. 
2. Add a title and a description that explain the changes you want to merge to the master repository. 
3. Click **Create Pull Request**.

Merging a Pull Request
----------------------

Pull requests will show up near the top of the main repository page. 

1. Click on **Pull Requests** to see what needs to be reviewed and then merged with the master repository. 

.. note:: Only review and merge content from another contributor, not your own content. 

2. View the file to review the content. 
3. If the content is accurate, merge the Pull Request with the master repository.

Closing Issues
--------------

After all of your Pull Requests for an **Issue** (Greek letter) have been reviewed and merged into the master repository, you can mark your **Issue** *closed* and remove the  *In Progress* label from the issue.
